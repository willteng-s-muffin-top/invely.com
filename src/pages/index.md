description: >-
  The Spirit of the Sovereign LORD is on me, because the LORD has anointed me to
  proclaim good news to the poor. He has sent me to bind up the brokenhearted,
  to proclaim freedom for the captives and release from darkness for the
  prisoners, to proclaim the year of the LORD's favor and the day of vengeance
  of our God, to comfort all who mourn, and provide for those who grieve in Zion
  to bestow on them a crown of beauty instead of ashes, the oil of joy instead
  of mourning, and a garment of praise instead of a spirit of despair. They will
  be called oaks of righteousness, a planting of the LORD for the display of his
  splendor. ISAIAH 61:1-3
